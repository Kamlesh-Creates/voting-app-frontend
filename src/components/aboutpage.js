           Hi, I'm <strong>Kamlesh Satpute</strong>, the developer behind this project. I built VoteBharat using the MERN stack â€” that's MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The idea was to create a smooth and secure voting experience that covers everything from user login to vote casting and admin controls.
